# TODO

## Menu

Make some menu interactions things which I can use for multiple projects like a TechnicalToolbox (perhaps the start of VisualScripting i VR!

While the menu is open, if controller select, get check if the controller is close enough to any of the menu buttons, button.do

### Grab-n-Slide:
a simple slider in 3d which follows a path set beforehand (probably just straight - but curved could be fun)

### Number Box:
box/quad with a number in it, click attached up and down arrows to change it

## More Colors
make more colors for players to choose

## Level Shape Editor
it would be nice to be able to make non-cube level shapes


## misc.

Is possible moves checker working? look into this

make a score counter on the black hole and some lights or whatever - space-opera basket ball hoop
