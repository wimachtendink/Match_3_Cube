## Menu

While the menu is open, if controller select, get check if the controller is close enough to any of the menu buttons, button.do

### Grab-n-Slide:
a simple slider in 3d which follows a path set beforehand (probably just straight - but curved could be fun)

### Number Box:
>>current  box/quad with a number in it, click attached up and down arrows to change it

## Level Shape Editor
